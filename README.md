# Preview: AWS Amplify's new code-first DX (Gen 2) for building backends

This next generation of Amplifyâ€™s backend building experience lets you author your frontend and backend definition completely with TypeScript, a file convention, and Git branch-based environments, is now available in Preview. To learn more, please visit [AWS Amplify (Gen 2)](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/).

## Quickstart 

To quickly get started with Amplify Gen 2, please visit [AWS Amplify (Gen 2) Quickstart](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/start/quickstart/).

## Manual Installation

First, if your frontend framework of choice doesn't have it already, create your project's `package.json` with `npm init -y`. Then, install the Amplify dependencies for building a backend:

```bash
npm add --save-dev @aws-amplify/backend @aws-amplify/backend-cli typescript
```

Next, create the entrypoint for your backend, `amplify/backend.ts`, with the following content:

```ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
defineBackend({});
```

Now you can run the following command to create your first backend!

```bash
npx amplify sandbox
```

### Define Amplify Auth

You can use `define*` functions to define your resources. For example, you can define authentication:

```ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  }
});
```

### Define Amplify Data

Define your data resource using the following command:

```ts
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;
export const data = defineData({
  schema
});
```
